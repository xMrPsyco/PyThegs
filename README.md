# PyThegs
PyThegs is a web scraping project in Python that has been made for the AC Web-Programming on the Academy for Creative Creative Economy.

Language: English. Version: 1.0, Python 3.9

You are now looking at my project. For this project the coding language Python 3 has been used. This project is about learning the basics about Python and scrape information from different websites. I made this project because I wanted to learn Python and specifically web scraping with Python. 

The project is divided into 6 projects. 

**Project 1: Python_Tutorial**:
In this project, I learned the basics of Python. What you'll find here are the files I wrote to help me learn the basics. 

**Project 2: Udemy_Project**:
In this project, you will find my first web scraper. For this web scraper I have used the libraries requests and BeautifulSoup. With this scraper you can grab the html tag, links and words from the website. I have made this scraper to understand the basics of web scraping and experiment with it.

**Project 3: Wikipedia_Project**:
This project is about scraping a table from a wikipedia page. For this web scraper I have used the libraries requests, BeautifulSoup and Pandas. Wit this scraper you can export the table on this wikipedia page. This script is only made for this page so it will not work on any other wikipedia pages with a table. To make it work for that, you have to change some things in the code. 

**Project 4: Weather App**:
This was a little project that can track the weather from every location you want. Open the file and fill in the places i name. After that you can succesfully run this script. 

**Project 5: Amazon_Scrapers**:
This was my biggest project so far. The Amazon Projects contains about 3 projects.

Amazon Page Scraper:
This project is about scraping all the urls from a keyword search in Ammazon. This script is useful for data analysts who need all the links for one product at once. 
For this project I have used the libraries requests_html and BeautifulSoup.
To run this script, search something on amazon. After that, copy the link and paste it in the script. 

Amazon Price Checker:
This project is about monitoring the price 24/7 on Amazon and when the price fell down, it will automatically send you an e-mail. This script is useful when you want to buy something at the lowest price point or want to keep track of your competitors. 
For this project I have used the libraries requests, BeautifulSoup, smtlib and time. 
To run this you have to fill in the link you want to scrape and your e-mail and password. 

Amazon Review Scraper: 
This project is about collecting reviews on Amazon and export it into a csv file. This script is useful for grabbing all the necessary review information at once and collect them in a csv file. 
For this project I have used the libraries requests, BeautifulSoup and Pandas.
To run this, you have to fill in the link you want to scrape and do some other adjustments that you can find in the script. 


**Project 6: Nike**:
This project is about collecting about products on the website from nike. This script was more for the fun but you can use it for marketing analysis. 
For this project I have used the libraries requests, BeautifulSoup, selenium, csv and time. 
To run this script, you only have to run this script. 

The next version of this project would include a project that allows you to monitor a product that is out of stock and when it comes available, you will get a notify in discord. 

It is possible to open the code, look at the code, copy it or change it via a program such as Visual Studio Code. Latest version of Visual Studio Code available from https://code.visualstudio.com/download.
